A PHP CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project is a basic web application that allows users to perform the four fundamental operations on a database. It typically involves:

Create: Adding new records to the database.
Read: Displaying records from the database.
Update: Modifying existing records in the database.
Delete: Removing records from the database.
The project uses PHP to handle server-side logic and MySQL as the database management system. It includes a simple user interface for interacting with the database through forms and tables. This type of project is ideal for learning database operations and server-side scripting with PHP.
